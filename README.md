#webot
webot is a kid-friendly programming platform designed and developed as
a tool to help introduce programming concepts to children ages 8 and up.
This project is based off my work in Education Technology Platforms and
will be the culmination of a number of months of development.
The original codebase can be found here (https://github.com/B-LAB/panyabot), 
though it is no longer maintained or developed on.
